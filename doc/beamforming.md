# Implementation of Beamforming

This document explains the implementation of beamforming in the OAI codebase: the
beam-index based schemes in which the beam weights live outside L2 (analog beamforming
at the RU, and digital beamforming driven by a digital beam table at L1), and the
scheduler constraints they impose.

[[_TOC_]]

## Introduction to beamforming

Beamforming is a technique applied to antenna arrays to create a directional radiation pattern. This often consists in providing a different phase shift to each element of the array such that signals with a different angle of arrival/departure experience a change in radiation pattern because of constructive or destructive interference.

There are three main beamforming techniques: analog, digital and hybrid. The names refer to the phase shift application before or after the digital to analog conversion (or analog to digital in reception). When we speak about analog beamforming we generally refer to a technique where the phase shifts that produce the beam steering are applied by the radio unit (RU) choosing from a finite set of steering directions. The advantage of analog beamforming is a simplified analog circuitry and therefore reduced costs.

The presence of a limited number of predefined beams at RU poses constraints to the scheduler at gNB. As a matter of fact, the scheduler can serve only a limited number of beams, depending on the RU characteristics (possibly only 1), in a given time scale, that also depends on the RU characteristics (e.g. 1 slot or 1 symbol). This limitation doesn't exist for digital beamforming.

Analog beamforming implementation also allows to enable distributed antenna systems (DAS), where each beam corresponds to one antenna (or a set of antennas) of the system. In this scenario, the scheduler constraint is alleviated because normally the number of concurrent beams allowed equals the total number of beams.

## Configuration file fields for beamforming

A set of parameters in configuration files controls the implementation of beamforming and instructs the scheduler on how to behave in such scenarios. Since most notably this technique in 5G is employed in FR2, the configuration file example currently available is a RFsim one for band 261. [Config file example](../ci-scripts/conf_files/gnb.sa.band257.u3.66prb.rfsim.conf)

Everything is controlled from the `MACRLC` section of the configuration file. The single parameter `bf_method` selects the beamforming method:
- `straight-wire` (default): no beamforming is applied, each logical antenna port maps straight onto a physical one.
- `das`: distributed antenna system, each beam is associated with one or more logical antenna ports. The beam index is the logical antenna port index, so `ssb_beams` must not be set and the number of concurrent beams equals `beams_per_period`. This is OAI-specific and is expected to be removed once the digital beam table is fully supported.
- `predefined`: the beam IDs allocated by L2 are signalled to L1 over FAPI. `ssb_beams` gives the beam ID to use for each transmitted SSB, and what L1 does with those IDs depends on whether a digital beam table (DBT) is configured:
  - with a DBT (`dbt_file`, or a DBT inlined in the `MACRLC` section), each beam ID names one of the DBT entries by its `beam_id` column and L1 applies the corresponding weights. The DBT is typically much larger than the number of SSBs, so the beam IDs in `ssb_beams` select a subset of it; a beam ID that does not appear in the table is rejected at startup.
  - without a DBT, L1 forwards the beam ID as is to the radio (e.g. an InterDigital frontend) or to the fronthaul (e.g. over 7.2x).
- `dynamic`: static beamforming for the control signals, with DLSCH/ULSCH precoded from the SRS channel estimate. Not implemented yet: selecting it aborts at startup.

The remaining parameters are:
- `beam_duration` is the number of slots (currently minimum duration of a beam) the scheduler is tied to a beam (default value is 1)
- `beams_per_period` is the number of concurrent beams the RU can handle in the beam duration (default value is 1)
- `ssb_beams` is a vector field containing the set of beam indices statically allocated to SSB/PRACH, required for `predefined`. The number of beam indices must be equal to the number of SSBs transmitted; a mismatch in either direction is rejected at startup.
- `dbt_file` is the path to a CSV file holding the digital beam table; the table can also be
  inlined in the same section as a `dbt` list. See [Digital beam table (DBT)](#digital-beam-table-dbt).

### Aerial section

With the NVIDIA Aerial L1 the physical antenna array is not described by an `RUs` section, so a separate top-level `Aerial` section carries the counts advertised to L1 in `CONFIG.request` as `numTxAnt`/`numRxAnt`:

```
Aerial = {
  num_tx_ant = 64;
  num_rx_ant = 64;
};
```

Both values are in 0..64. They are the *physical* antennas, kept apart from the logical antenna ports (`numTxPort`/`numRxPort`), which are still derived from `pdsch_AntennaPorts_*` and `pusch_AntennaPorts`: `numRxAnt` sizes the L1 uplink receive processing, so deriving it from the logical ports used to cost the array gain of every antenna beyond the configured number of UL layers.

The section is required for `bf_method = "predefined"` and `"dynamic"`, which apply the beam weights, or the SRS-based precoder, per physical antenna. For `straight-wire` and `das` it is optional, and the counts keep being derived from the logical ports when it is absent.

`bf_method` replaces the previous `set_analog_beamforming` parameter, and `ssb_beams` replaces `beam_weights`; DAS is no longer selected with `enable_das` in the `L1` section. Configuration files still using the old parameters are rejected at startup with a message pointing at the replacement.

## Digital beam table (DBT)

The digital beam table maps each beam ID to a vector of complex weights, one per TXRU
(the physical antenna elements the weights are applied to). It is what turns
`bf_method = "predefined"` from "pass the beam ID through to the RU" into "L1 applies
these weights": with a table, L1 resolves each beam ID through it; without one, the ID
is forwarded unchanged to the radio or the fronthaul.

A DBT is only meaningful for `predefined`. Configuring one together with
`straight-wire` or `das` is rejected at startup.

It is also only supported with Aerial for the time being. The table does reach a native
L1, but `nr_feptx_prec()` copies the samples through instead of precoding them, so the
weights would have no effect; configuring a table without Aerial is rejected rather than
silently ignored.

The table can come from either of two places, checked in this order:

1. `dbt_file`, a path to a CSV file (relative to the working directory of the gNB process);
2. a `dbt` list inlined in the same `MACRLC` section.

If `dbt_file` is set to a non-empty string it wins, and an inline `dbt` list is ignored.

### CSV format

The first line is a header. Its contents are ignored, but its column count defines the
number of weights per beam. Each following line describes one beam: the first column is
the beam ID (decimal, 0 to 65535), the remaining columns are the complex weights.

```csv
beam_id,txru0,txru1,txru2,txru3
0,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5
1,0.5,0.5-0.5i,-0.5,-0.5+0.5i
68,0.5,-0.5,0.5,-0.5
```

Every row must carry exactly as many weight columns as the header announced; a row with
too few or too many columns aborts startup. Note that the header is mandatory: a file
that starts directly with data has its first beam consumed as the header.

### Inline format

The same table can be written directly in the `MACRLC` section as a `dbt` list. Each
element is itself a list of strings: the first is the beam ID, the rest are the weights.
Note that the elements are bare lists, not groups — there is no key in front of them.

```
MACRLCs = (
{
  ...
  bf_method        = "predefined";
  beam_duration    = 1;
  beams_per_period = 1;
  ssb_beams        = [1];
  dbt = (
    ("0", "0.5", "0.5",      "0.5",  "0.5"),
    ("1", "0.5", "0.5-0.5i", "-0.5", "-0.5+0.5i")
  );
}
);
```

All rows must have the same number of weights; the first row sets the expected width.
Note that the values are quoted: the weights are parsed by OAI, not by libconfig, which
is what allows the complex forms below.

### Weight syntax

Each weight is a single token, in one of three forms, with either `i` or `j` marking the
imaginary unit:

| form           | examples                  |
|----------------|---------------------------|
| real only      | `0.5`, `-0.25`, `1`       |
| imaginary only | `0.5i`, `-0.5j`           |
| complex        | `0.5+0.5i`, `0.5-0.5j`    |

In the complex form the imaginary part must carry an explicit sign, so that the two
numbers can be told apart.

Both the real and the imaginary part must lie in [-1, 1]. They are converted to Q15
(multiplied by 32767 and rounded) before being handed to L1, so the table is written in
normalised floating point and the fixed-point conversion is done for you.

The number of weights per beam must equal the number of physical antenna ports, and a
mismatch is rejected at startup. Under Aerial that count is `num_tx_ant` of the
[`Aerial` section](#aerial-section). Should a native L1 gain DBT support, it would
instead be the sum of `nb_tx` over the `RUs` section.

### Beam IDs and their relation to `ssb_beams`

Beam IDs name the rows of the table; they are arbitrary 16-bit values and do not have to
start at zero, be contiguous, or be sorted, but they must be unique — a table listing the
same ID twice is rejected at startup. A table typically holds many more beams than
there are SSBs, so `ssb_beams` selects the subset used for SSB/PRACH, one entry per
transmitted SSB. Every ID listed in `ssb_beams` must appear in the table, otherwise
startup fails with

```
ssb_beams[<i>] = <id> is not a beam of the digital beam table (<n> entries)
```

With a table configured, L1 resolves each beam ID through it; without one, the IDs are
passed on to the RU or the fronthaul unchanged.

### What reaches L1

The table is sent to L1 in the `CONFIG.request` as a vendor-extension TLV
(`nfapi_nr_dbt_pdu_t`): `num_dig_beams` entries of `num_txrus` weights each, every entry
carrying its `beam_idx` and a list of Q15 real/imaginary pairs. At startup the gNB logs

```
Loaded DBT: num_beams=<n> num_weights_per_beam=<m>
```

with the individual weights available at debug log level.

## Implementation in OAI scheduler

A new MAC structure `NR_beam_info_t` controls the behavior of the scheduler in presence of analog beamforming. Besides the already mentioned parameters `beam_duration` and `beams_per_period`, the structure also holds a matrix `beam_allocation[i][j]`, whose indices `i` and `j` stands respectively for the number of beams in the period and the slot index (the size of the latter depends on the frame characteristics).
This matrix contains the beams already allocated in a given slot, to flag the scheduler to use one of these to schedule a UE in one of these beams. If the matrix is full (all the beams in the given period, e.g. slot) are already allocated, the scheduler can't allocate a UE in a new beam.
To this goal, we extended the virtual resource block (VRB) map by one dimension to also contain information per allocated beam. As said, the scheduler can independently schedule users in a number of beams up to `beams_per_period` concurrently.

It is important to note that in current implementation, there are several periodical channels, e.g. PRACH or PUCCH for CSI et cetera, that have the precendence in being assigned a beam, that is because the scheduling is automatic, set in RRC configuration, and not up to the scheduler. For these instances, we assume the beam is available (if not there are assertions to stop the process). For data channels, the currently implemented PF scheduler is used. The only modification is that a UE can be served only if there is a free beam available or the one of the beams already in use correspond to that UE beam.

## Beams in phy-test scheduler

In phy-test mode, beams are assigned to PDSCH slots in the same manner as SSB slots with the only addition that it repeats for every TDD period in a frame. For example if PDSCH is scheduled on all DL slot for TDD format DDDDDDDSUU, and with SSB bit map = `0b1010101` and the following beam parameters in config file,
- `ssb_beams` = [10,11,12,13]
- `beam_duration` = 1
- `beams_per_period` = 1

The DL slots in every TDD period will have beams 10,11,12,13,0,0,0

## FAPI implementation

To be noted that in our implementation analog beamforming is only partially supported in split mode.
The index based beamforming relies on the beam-ID of the Tx precoding and beamforming PDU, which is present only in the most recent versions of SCF PHY API specifications (at least from v8 and later, possibly from v6).

In addition to that, a `config_request` structure defined as vendor extension (`nfapi_nr_analog_beamforming_ve_t`) configures the lower layers at initialization with the following information:
- `analog_bf_vendor_ext` which can assume values 1 or 0 for enabling or disabling analog beamforming

L2 then provides the beam index in each channel FAPI message via the beam-ID parameter.

## L1 implementation

The total number of logical antenna ports available at L1 is same as `pusch_AntennaPorts * beams_per_period` in UL and `pdsch_AntennaPorts_N1 * pdsch_AntennaPorts_N2 * pdsch_AntennaPorts_XP * beams_per_period` in DL.
To handle multiple concurrent beams, L2 uses spatial stream indices specified by FAPI to signal L1 on which logical ports to use for a DL or UL signal. The config file parameter `spatial_stream_index` can be used to specify an array of logical port indices to be used. If this parameter is not provided then the indices defaults to `[0 ... pusch_AntennaPorts - 1]`. This parameter is particularly useful when a specific subset of eAxCID has to be used.
In case of DAS (`bf_method = "das"`), since each beam corresponds to a specific antenna port, the `beam_index_allocation` function is simplified in the sense that the beam index corresponds to the antenna port index of the frequency domain buffers.

## RU implementation

The implementation is still work in progress.

The first dimension of the Tx and Rx buffers contains the number of Tx/Rx antennas which is at least the number of logical antenna ports.
