# Implementation of Analog Beamforming

This document explains the implementation of analog beamforming in OAI codebase.

## Introduction to analog beamforming

Beamforming is a technique applied to antenna arrays to create a directional radiation pattern. This often consists in providing a different phase shift to each element of the array such that signals with a different angle of arrival/departure experience a change in radiation pattern because of constructive or destructive interference.

There are three main beamforming techniques: analog, digital and hybrid. The names refer to the phase shift application before or after the digital to analog conversion (or analog to digital in reception). When we speak about analog beamforming we generally refer to a technique where the phase shifts that produce the beam steering are applied by the radio unit (RU) choosing from a finite set of steering directions. The advantage of analog beamforming is a simplified analog circuitry and therefore reduced costs.

The presence of a limited number of predefined beams at RU poses constraints to the scheduler at gNB. As a matter of fact, the scheduler can serve only a limited number of beams, depending on the RU characteristics (possibly only 1), in a given time scale, that also depends on the RU characteristics (e.g. 1 slot or 1 symbol). This limitation doesn't exist for digital beamforming.

Analog beamforming implementation also allows to enable distributed antenna systems (DAS), where each beam corresponds to one antenna (or a set of antennas) of the system. In this scenario, the scheduler constraint is alleviated because normally the number of concurrent beams allowed equals the total number of beams.

## Configuration file fields for beamforming

A set of parameters in configuration files controls the implementation of beamforming and instructs the scheduler on how to behave in such scenarios. Since most notably this technique in 5G is employed in FR2, the configuration file example currently available is a RFsim one for band 261. [Config file example](../ci-scripts/conf_files/gnb.sa.band257.u3.66prb.rfsim.conf)

Everything is controlled from the `MACRLC` section of the configuration file. The single parameter `mimo_mode` selects the mode:
- `plain` (default): no beamforming is applied.
- `das`: distributed antenna system, each beam is associated with one or more logical antenna ports. The beam index is the logical antenna port index, so `ssb_beams` must not be set and the number of concurrent beams equals `beams_per_period`.
- `predefined`: the beam IDs allocated by L2 are signalled to L1 over FAPI. `ssb_beams` gives the beam ID to use for each transmitted SSB, and what L1 does with those IDs depends on whether a digital beam table (DBT) is configured:
  - with a DBT (`dbt_file`, or a DBT inlined in the `MACRLC` section), each beam ID names one of the DBT entries by its `beam_id` column and L1 applies the corresponding weights. The DBT is typically much larger than the number of SSBs, so the beam IDs in `ssb_beams` select a subset of it; a beam ID that does not appear in the table is rejected at startup.
  - without a DBT, L1 forwards the beam ID as is to the radio (e.g. an InterDigital frontend) or to the fronthaul (e.g. over 7.2x).
- `dynamic`: static beamforming for the control signals, with DLSCH/ULSCH precoded from the SRS channel estimate. Not implemented yet: selecting it aborts at startup.

The remaining parameters are:
- `beam_duration` is the number of slots (currently minimum duration of a beam) the scheduler is tied to a beam (default value is 1)
- `beams_per_period` is the number of concurrent beams the RU can handle in the beam duration (default value is 1)
- `ssb_beams` is a vector field containing the set of beam indices statically allocated to SSB/PRACH, required for `predefined`. The number of beam indices should be equal to the number of SSBs transmitted.
- `dbt_file` is the path to a CSV file holding the digital beam table

The MSB of the FAPI beam ID tells L1 how to interpret the remaining bits: it is set when the beam ID is used as is (`das`, and `predefined` without a DBT) and cleared when it is a pointer into a pre-stored set of weights (`predefined` with a DBT).

`mimo_mode` replaces the previous `set_analog_beamforming` parameter, and `ssb_beams` replaces `beam_weights`; DAS is no longer selected with `enable_das` in the `L1` section. Configuration files still using the old parameters are rejected at startup with a message pointing at the replacement.

## Implementation in OAI scheduler

A new MAC structure `NR_beam_info_t` controls the behavior of the scheduler in presence of analog beamforming. Besides the already mentioned parameters `beam_duration` and `beams_per_period`, the structure also holds a matrix `beam_allocation[i][j]`, whose indices `i` and `j` stands respectively for the number of beams in the period and the slot index (the size of the latter depends on the frame characteristics).
This matrix contains the beams already allocated in a given slot, to flag the scheduler to use one of these to schedule a UE in one of these beams. If the matrix is full (all the beams in the given period, e.g. slot) are already allocated, the scheduler can't allocate a UE in a new beam.
To this goal, we extended the virtual resource block (VRB) map by one dimension to also contain information per allocated beam. As said, the scheduler can independently schedule users in a number of beams up to `beams_per_period` concurrently.

It is important to note that in current implementation, there are several periodical channels, e.g. PRACH or PUCCH for CSI et cetera, that have the precendence in being assigned a beam, that is because the scheduling is automatic, set in RRC configuration, and not up to the scheduler. For these instances, we assume the beam is available (if not there are assertions to stop the process). For data channels, the currently implemented PF scheduler is used. The only modification is that a UE can be served only if there is a free beam available or the one of the beams already in use correspond to that UE beam.

## Beams in phy-test scheduler

In phy-test mode, beams are assigned to PDSCH slots in the same manner as SSB slots with the only addition that it repeats for every TDD period in a frame. For example if PDSCH is scheduled on all DL slot for TDD format DDDDDDDSUU, and with SSB bit map = `0b1010101` and the following beam parameters in config file,
- `ssb_beams` = [10,11,12,13]
- `beam_duration` = 1
- `beams_per_period` = 1

The DL slots in every TDD period will have beams 10,11,12,13,0,0,0

## FAPI implementation

To be noted that in our implementation analog beamforming is only partially supported in split mode.
The index based beamforming relies on the Tx precoding and beamforming PDU definition of beam-ID, where MSB is used to signal if the ID can be directly used or is it a pointer to a pre-stored vector of weights.
This definition of beam-ID is present only in the most recent versions of SCF PHY API specifications (at least from v8 and later, possibly from v6).

In addition to that, a `config_request` structure defined as vendor extension (`nfapi_nr_analog_beamforming_ve_t`) configures the lower layers at initialization with the following information:
- `analog_bf_vendor_ext` which can assume values 1 or 0 for enabling or disabling analog beamforming

Therefore, when the beam ID is meant to be consumed by the RU or the fronthaul, L2 provides in each channel FAPI message information about the beam index via the beam-ID parameter with MSB set to 1.

## L1 implementation

The total number of logical antenna ports available at L1 is same as `pusch_AntennaPorts * beams_per_period` in UL and `pdsch_AntennaPorts_N1 * pdsch_AntennaPorts_N2 * pdsch_AntennaPorts_XP * beams_per_period` in DL.
To handle multiple concurrent beams, L2 uses spatial stream indices specified by FAPI to signal L1 on which logical ports to use for a DL or UL signal. The config file parameter `spatial_stream_index` can be used to specify an array of logical port indices to be used. If this parameter is not provided then the indices defaults to `[0 ... pusch_AntennaPorts - 1]`. This parameter is particularly useful when a specific subset of eAxCID has to be used.
In case of DAS (`mimo_mode = "das"`), since each beam corresponds to a specific antenna port, the `beam_index_allocation` function is simplified in the sense that the beam index corresponds to the antenna port index of the frequency domain buffers.

## RU implementation

The implementation is still work in progress.

The first dimension of the Tx and Rx buffers contains the number of Tx/Rx antennas which is at least the number of logical antenna ports.
